1. Take your portfolio PDF file
2. Rename it to `portfolio.pdf` 
3. Place it in the `public/` directory of your project

**File Location:** `app/public/portfolio.pdf`

### Step 2: Verify the Setup
- The PDF viewer will automatically load `/portfolio.pdf`
- Users can navigate through pages using the Previous/Next buttons
- Users can zoom in/out using the zoom controls
- Users can jump to specific pages using the page input field
- A download button is provided for users to download the full PDF

## Customization Options

### Changing PDF Height
In `app/components/Portfolio.jsx`, you can modify the height of the PDF viewer:
```jsx
<PDFViewer 
  file="/portfolio.pdf" 
  height="700px"  // Change this value
/>
```

### Changing PDF File Path
If you want to use a different filename or location, update the file path in `Portfolio.jsx`:
```jsx
<PDFViewer 
  file="/your-custom-filename.pdf" 
  height="700px"
/>
```

### Download Button Text
You can customize the download button text in `Portfolio.jsx`:
```jsx
Download Portfolio PDF  // Change this text
```

## Testing Your Setup

1. Place your `portfolio.pdf` file in `app/public/`
2. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to the Portfolio section on your website
4. Verify that:
   - PDF loads correctly
   - Navigation buttons work
   - Zoom controls function properly
   - Download button works

## Troubleshooting

### PDF Not Loading
- Check that the file is named exactly `portfolio.pdf`
- Verify the file is in the `app/public/` directory
- Ensure the PDF file is not corrupted
- Check browser console for error messages

### Slow Loading
- Optimize your PDF file size (compress images, reduce quality if needed)
- Consider splitting very large portfolios into multiple smaller PDFs

### Mobile Issues
- The viewer is responsive, but very large PDFs may take longer to load on mobile
- Consider creating a mobile-optimized version of your portfolio

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Professional Presentation**: Clean, document-like presentation
2. **Easy Updates**: Simply replace the PDF file to update your portfolio
3. **Better Performance**: Single file load instead of multiple images/videos
4. **User-Friendly**: Familiar PDF navigation controls
5. **Download Option**: Users can save your portfolio for offline viewing
